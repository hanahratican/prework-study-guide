# Prework Study Guide

## Description
This webpage is to be used as a study guide for bootcamp students. It is a place where information about the prework topics (HTML, CSS, Git, Javascript) is organized and can be found easily. I built this project because I wanted to be able to quickly refer to this information while I study. It solves the problem of having unorganized notes by providing one place where these notes are stored. 
Through this project, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript, and how to implement these to build a simple web application.

## Usage
This webpage can be used by students wanting to study the prework topics. To do so, open the webpage and see that the different topics are separated and notes are organized according to what topic they refer to. You may use this information to quickly refresh your memory, to create flash cards, etc. If you open the DevTools console, you will be able to see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics, and choose a topic for you to begin studying.
