        <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML is a front-end programming language that is  responsible for the content on a webpage, such as pictures, links, and text.</li>
            <li>You use opening and closing tags in HTML.</li>
            <li>There are parent elements, which contain other elements withing them.</li>
            <li>There are child elements, which are the elements that are nested inside the parent elements.</li>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element, and is always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a front-end programming language that is responsible for the layout of a webpage.</li>
          <li>CSS is where you create what the webpage looks like</li>
          <li>We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them with a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>CSS defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file. </li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet: embedded directly in the HTML file using a style element within the head element.</li>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheet: when we link the external CSS file to our HTML file using a link element placed withing the HTML head element.</li>
          <li>*Separation of Concerns*: based on the idea that each section of code should have it's own responsibility.</li>

        <h2>Git and GitHub</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control software that is installed on your computer.</li>
          <li>Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.</li>
          <li>You use the command line to make git commands.</li>
          <li>The //git status command allows you to check what branch you are currently on.</li>
          <li>the //git checkout -b branch-name allows you to create a new branch and switch to it.</li>
          <li>Git and GitHub are two separate things: Git is the version control software, and GitHub is a web application where you can store your code remotely.</li>
          <li>GitHub allows you to work collaboratively with others on code. You can track all previous changes in code and revert back to older versions of code easily if needed.</li>
          <li>In Github, you work on branches. The main branch is the branch that affects the live site. You usually do not work in the main branch. You work off of feature branches, so that if any code breaks, it does not affect the live site.</li>
          <li>As you code, you make commits with every change you make to code. Commits are like snapshots of code that you can go back to.</li>
          <li>When you are satisfied with the changes, you can make a pull request (PR) for your code to be merged into the main branch.</li>
          <li>Once you have made a PR, others can review your code and make comments and suggestions on how to better your code.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, a PR needs to be approved before the merge can take place.</li>
          <li>Once your code has been reviewed and approved, it is then merged into the main branch!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that makes the website interactive; this includes actions such as clicking a like button, typing into a box, or being able to click and drag.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse.</li>
          <li>Arguments go in parentheses and is a bit of data that functions need to do their job.</li>
